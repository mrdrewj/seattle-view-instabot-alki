# seattle-view-instabot-alki
Simple set of python scripts that can be used to "scrape" a .jpg from a URL, store it by its UNIX date and also post it to Instagram using Instabot. These scripts would be run with cron. I currently collect an image every 10 minutes and post one to Instagram every 2 hours.  Check out the project on instagram @one_view_of_seattle
